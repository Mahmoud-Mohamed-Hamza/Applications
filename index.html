  <h1>AI Applications</h1>
  <h2>
  1. AI in E-Commerce
       Personalized Shopping
       Artificial Intelligence technology is used to create recommendation engines through which 
       you can engage better with your customers. These recommendations are made in accordance
       with their browsing history, preference, and interests. It helps in improving your 
       relationship with your customers and their loyalty towards your brand.
                    
     AI-powered Assistants
       Virtual shopping assistants and chatbots help improve the user experience while shopping online.
       Natural Language Processing is used to make the conversation sound as human and personal as 
       possible. Moreover, these assistants can have real-time engagement with your customers. Did you
       know that on amazon.com, soon, customer service could be handled by chatbots?
                    
     Fraud Prevention
       Credit card frauds and fake reviews are two of the most significant issues that E-Commerce companies
       deal with. By considering the usage patterns, AI can help reduce the possibility of credit card frauds
       taking place. Many customers prefer to buy a product or service based on customer reviews. AI can 
       help identify and handle fake reviews. 
                    
     2.AI in Navigation
       Based on research from MIT, GPS technology can provide users with accurate, timely, and detailed 
       information to improve safety. The technology uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and 
       Graph Neural Network, which makes lives easier for users by automatically detecting the number of 
       lanes and road types behind obstructions on the roads. AI is heavily used by Uber and many logistics 
       companies to improve operational efficiency, analyze road traffic, and optimize routes.

     3. AI in Robotics
       Robotics is another field where artificial intelligence applications are commonly used. Robots powered by
       AI use real-time updates to sense obstacles in its path and pre-plan its journey instantly. 
       It can be used for
       Carrying goods in hospitals, factories, and warehouses
       Cleaning offices and large equipment
       Inventory management

     4. AI in Human Resource
       Did you know that companies use intelligent software to ease the hiring process?
       Artificial Intelligence helps with blind hiring. Using machine learning software, you can examine 
       applications based on specific parameters. AI drive systems can scan job candidates' profiles, and
       resumes to provide recruiters an understanding of the talent pool they must choose from.  
                    
    5. AI in Healthcare
       Artificial Intelligence finds diverse applications in the healthcare sector. AI is used in healthcare
       to build sophisticated machines that can detect diseases and identify cancer cells. AI can help analyze
       chronic conditions with lab and other medical data to ensure early diagnosis. AI uses the combination 
       of historical data and medical intelligence for the discovery of new drugs.
